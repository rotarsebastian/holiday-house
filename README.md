## Instructions

Some prerequistes to be able to launch this project, is that you have node and git installed on your computer, a database server ready to run on your localhost.
Second to this, we have removed our gmail, AWS and Mapbox access keys for security reasons from the code, and as you would need to have your own access keys for
all of these services - we recommend you visit our hosted version instead, and refer to the code.

Here is the link to the hosted version:

## If you want to launch it on your machine anyways

1. Unzip the compressed zip file.
2. Set up the config file in the server folder, based on the template you have for each file.
3. In your terminal, open the project folder and navigate to both the server and client folders. Run `npm install` in both of them.
4. Start your server by running `node app.js` in the server folder.
5. Start your client by running `npm start` in the client folder.
